EECS 351 Final Project
======================
Frame-Encoded Audio Watermarking

Zak Kerhoulas, Josh Cheng, Rachel Nowak

## Quick Start
First, install the latest versions of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) Then, use Anaconda to create a virtual environment and install the required packages and libraries. 
```console
$ conda create --name <your-env-name> python=3.13
$ conda activate <your-env-name>
$ conda install --file requirements.txt
```
Now you should be able to run through the Jupyter notebook containing our code! If you're looking to demo our algorithm, I would simply click "Run All" while going through the notebook. It is preset with an example audio file, watermark, and embedding frequency.
